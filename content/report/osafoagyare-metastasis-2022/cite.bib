 abstract = {Metastasis is major contributor towards cancer-related mortality and can be difficult to detect
during early stages. The ability to identify cancers that may have already metastasized can help increase
patient survival. In this study, we utilize publicly available expression profile datasets of cancers from
primary sites with or without distal metastasis. We train an elastic net models to predict the origin of
primary cancer tissue and whether the primary cancer has metastasized or not.},
