 abstract = {In recent years, life insurance companies in Ghana have had to grapple with the
challenge of policy surrenders, as the rate keeps increasing to unprecedented levels by the day, in spite of the increasing education and awareness to boost the
insurance penetration rate, which is currently below two per cent (2%). The factors having significant effects on surrender of life policies, however, are company
specific. This study was therefore conducted to estimate the prospect of a life
policy holder surrendering, and to identify the factors having significant effects
on this surrender in the life insurance companies.
With regards to these study objectives, secondary data was obtained from the
SIC Life from the period of 1st January, 1998 to 31st December 2016, constituting
a data size of 73642 policyholders. The Kaplan-Meier estimates were computed
for these data points to identify what time period experienced most surrender,
and was evident that, most life policyholders tend to surrender within their third
year of policy subscription, with a surrender probability of ...., signifying the
highest among all other policy years. With age, gender, income level, customer’s
dissatisfaction with services provided, need for emergency fund, interest rate arbitrage and subscription onto new policies as the covariates under consideration,
a Cox-Proportional Hazard(Cox-ph) was fitted. Results indicated that, age,.....
do no significantly affect the likelihood of a policyholder surrendering his/her life
policy at 5% significance level. However, at 5% level of significance, gender, income level, customer’s dissatisfaction with services provided, need for emergency
fund, interest rate arbitrage and subscription onto new policies proved to have
significant effect on policy surrender.},
