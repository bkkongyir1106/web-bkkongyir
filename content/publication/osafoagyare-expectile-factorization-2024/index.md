abstract: This study investigates the impact of macroeconomic indicators on US home prices, underscoring the importance of understanding these dynamics due to their significant socio-economic consequences. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, originally collected by FRED, the research examines variables such as the Consumer Price Index, Population, Unemployment, GDP, Stock Prices, Income, and Mortgage Rates to discern their effect on housing market fluctuations. The analysis identifies multicollinearity among predictors, necessitating a shift from traditional multiple linear regression to a more robust bootstrap regression method due to violations of parametric assumptions.

Key findings reveal that Real Disposable Income is a significant predictor of home prices, although the presence of multicollinearity complicates the model-building process. The bootstrap regression approach, favored for its resilience to assumption violations, confirms the influence of selected macroeconomic factors on home prices. The study concludes that bootstrap regression provides a reliable alternative to parametric methods in cases of assumption non-compliance and highlights the critical role of addressing multicollinearity in regression analysis. This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders involved in the housing market, highlighting the importance of careful econometric modeling in informing economic policy and investment decisions.
