For instance, say that you want to find and extract all the email addresses in a document automatically. How might we do that?\n","\n","Let us look at some tools that we will employ in finding patterns in strings:\n","<br><br><br><br>\n","### **(1.1) Special characters**\n","- `. \\ | ( ) [ ] ^ $ { } * + ?`\n","- Note that `\\t` and `\\n` match the tab and newline characters.\n","- If you want the \"literal\" versions of any of the reserved characters, you will need to escape them with a backslash `\\`, e.g. `[\\.\\\\\\|]`\n","\n","\n","<br> \n","### **(1.2) Character classes**\n","- `.` matches anything (wildcard)\n","- `[aeiou]` matches a single character in the set provided\n","- `[^aeiou]` matches a single character **NOT** in the set\n","- `[a-e]` matches a range, equivalent to `[abcde]`\n","\n","<br> \n","### **(1.3) Shorthand**\n","- `\\w` matches a \"word\" character, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, i.e alphanumeric plus underscore characters.\n","- `\\s` matches any whitespace, including tabs and newlines\n","- `\\d` matches digits, equivalent to `[0-9]`\n","- `\\W`, `\\S`, and `\\D` match the opposite of the lower-case versions\n","\n","\n","<br> \n","### **(1.4) Grouping**\n","- `()` are used to group patterns together.
