I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Statistics program](https://cas.okstate.edu/statistics/) at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I hail from Lawra-Tolibri, a vibrant town in the Upper West Region of Ghana known for its rich culture and warm hospitality. I earned my MS in [Mathematics](https://academics.ysu.edu/mathematics-and-statistics) at Youngstown State University and my BS in Actuarial Science from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/). I am a proud 'Xavascan'. I work under the guidance of [Professor Pratyaydipta Rudra](https://experts.okstate.edu/prudra), with my research centered on evaluating the utility of normality tests in statistical practice—work that bridges theoretical rigor with practical applications in modern data analysis.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about social impact and co-founded Konbar, a social enterprise tackling malnutrition and food insecurity through sustainable dry-season irrigation farming in rural Africa. I also enjoy teaching, tutoring statistics, and contributing as a science fair judge to inspire the next generation of thinkers. When I’m not immersed in data or community work, you’ll likely find me listening to music, or enjoying meaningful conversations.
